# Content Based Recommenders

In this project we have a set of exercises on **Content Based Recommenders**.
At its simplest, in order to build a content based recommender we need to do the following:

1) Model items according to relevant attributes;

2) Model or reveal user preferences by attributes;

Content based recommender matches item attributes against user preferences profile.

The project contains three Jupyter notebooks, and each notebook is dedicated to a particular
exercise. I will be using Python, Numpy and Pandas to complete the exercises.

## Project Notebooks

- **Exercise 1:** User Basic Profile

- **Exercise 2:** Weighted User Profile

- **Exercise 3:** Term Frequency and Document Frequency
